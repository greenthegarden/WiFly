This is a copy of a fork of the SparkFun WiFly Shield Arduino Library which I have added as a separate repository for debugging purposes.

The original library can be found at https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_WiFly_Shield_Arduino_Library
The fork I have based this copy on can be found at https://github.com/dpslwk/WiFly
